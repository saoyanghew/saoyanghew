Hi! My name is Sao Yang. 

I work at an insurance company, and I am completing my actuarial qualifications. 

I am educated in Monash University, with a BCom in Actuarial Science and a BCom (Hons) in Econometrics. I have also garnered extensive knowledge in financial mathematics through the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Monash - and can help with a variety of financial mathematics, stochastic process, machine learning and data analytics related concepts.

This is a space where I provide and share code on items related to areas of research that I'm interested in: actuarial studies, financial and insurance mathematics, and econometric methods. 

I code in R, Python, SQL, Julia, and C++, and have extensive knowledge in other proprietary software for statistical modelling as well! This includes Stata, MATLAB, EViews, SAS and more. 

I am also keen to learn more about other areas that employ mathematical modelling and statistical methods - e.g., infectious diseases modelling, social network analysis and computational neuroscience.
