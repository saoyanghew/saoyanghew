Hi! My name is Sao Yang. 

I work at an insurance company as an actuarial analyst, and I am completing my professional qualifications with the Actuaries Institute as well. 

I am educated by Monash University, with a BCom in Actuarial Science, and a BCom (Hons) in Econometrics. I have also garnered extensive knowledge in financial mathematics through the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Monash - and can help with many financial mathematics/stochastic process related items!

This is a space where I provide and share code on items related to areas of research that I'm interested in: actuarial studies, financial and insurance mathematics, and econometric methods. 

I code in R, Python, SQL and Julia, and have extensive knowledge in other open source and proprietary software for statistical modelling as well! This includes SAS, Stata, MATLAB, EViews and more. 

I am also keen to learn more about other areas that employ mathematical modelling and statistical methods - e.g., infectious diseases modelling, social network analysis and computational neuroscience.
