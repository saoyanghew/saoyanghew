Hi! My name is Sao Yang. 
I’m currently working on a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) in Econometrics and Financial Mathematics, to be completed by the end of 2021.

I am interested in performing research, and improving methods within actuarial science, financial mathematics and econometrics. I'm also interested in mathematical biology (
infectious diseases modelling, computational neuroscience), C++ programming, social network analysis (SNA) and Japanese literature! Hit me up at saoyang.icube@gmail.com.
